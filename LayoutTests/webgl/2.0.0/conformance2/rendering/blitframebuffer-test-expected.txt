[ 1: PASS ] WebGL context exists
[ 2: PASS ] should be red at first
[ 3: PASS ] should be green
[ 4: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should succeed.
[ 5: FAIL ] getError expected: INVALID_OPERATION. Was NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should generate INVALID_OPERATION if read/draw buffer are identical.
[ 6: FAIL ] getError expected: INVALID_OPERATION. Was NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should generate INVALID_OPERATION if read/draw buffer are identical.
[ 7: FAIL ] getError expected: INVALID_OPERATION. Was NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should generate INVALID_OPERATION if read/draw color buffer are identical.
[ 8: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should succeed if read/draw buffer has the same image with different levels.
[ 9: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should succeed if read/draw buffer has the same CUBE_MAP image with different faces.
[ 10: FAIL ] getError expected: NO_ERROR. Was INVALID_ENUM : blitFramebuffer should succeed if read/draw buffer has the same 3D/2D_ARRAY image with different layers.
[ 11: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should succeed.
[ 12: FAIL ] getError expected: INVALID_OPERATION. Was NO_ERROR : blitFramebuffer should generate INVALID_OPERATION if read/draw framebuffer have identical depth buffer attachment.
[ 13: FAIL ] Framebuffer incomplete.
