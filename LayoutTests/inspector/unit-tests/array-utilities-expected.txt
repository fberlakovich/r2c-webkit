== Running test suite: ArrayUtilities
-- Running test case: Array.prototype.lowerBound
PASS: lowerBound of a value before the first value should produce the first index.
PASS: lowerBound of a value in the list should return the value's index.
PASS: lowerBound of a value in the list should return the value's index.
PASS: lowerBound of a value in the list should return the value's index.
PASS: lowerBound of a duplicate value in the list should return the value's first index.
PASS: lowerBound of a value in a gap in the list should return the index where the value would be.
PASS: lowerBound of a value after the last value should produce the index after the last index (length).
PASS: lowerBound with a comparator should invoke the comparator with the search value and a value in the list.

-- Running test case: Array.prototype.upperBound
PASS: upperBound of a value before the first value should produce the first index.
PASS: upperBound of a value in the list should return the next index after the value.
PASS: upperBound of a value in the list should return the next index after the value.

PASS: upperBound of a duplicate value in the list should return the next index after the value's last index.
PASS: upperBound of a value in a gap in the list should return the index where the value would be.
PASS: upperBound of a value after the last value should produce the index after the last index (length).
PASS: upperBound with a comparator should invoke the comparator with the search value and a value in the list.
