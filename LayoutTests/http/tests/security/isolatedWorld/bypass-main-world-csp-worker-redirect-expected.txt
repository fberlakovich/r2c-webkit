This tests that in an isolated world that the Content Security Policy of the parent origin (this page) is bypassed and a CSP violation is not triggered when a Web Worker's script URL loads a different origin through a redirect. This test PASSED if there is no CSP violation console message and the redirect fails (since Web Workers can only load a script from the same origin).

PASS worker failed to load script URL.
