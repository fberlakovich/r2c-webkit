FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
This test checks that the yellow reference DOM node (which should be as big as the window) gets resized when the window is resized.

To avoid relayouts and repaints caused by DOM-based logging, it doesn't output anything. Please check the console for confirmation that the node dimensions increase by 10x10.
