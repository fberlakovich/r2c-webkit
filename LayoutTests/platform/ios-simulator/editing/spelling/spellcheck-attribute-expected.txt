FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
This tests if the "spellcheck" attribute is implemented as written in its specification. If this test succeeds, you can see forms filled with an invalid word "zz". Nevertheless, the "zz" is not marked as misspelled in all of them.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


<DIV id=div1 spellcheck=true>
<INPUT id=test1_1 type=text>zz </INPUT>
test1_1
