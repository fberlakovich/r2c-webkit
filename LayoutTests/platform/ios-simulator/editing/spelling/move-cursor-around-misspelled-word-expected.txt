FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
The test verifies if the misspelled underline remains when the caret is moved to the beginning, end and in middle of a word that is marked as misspelled. The test succeeds if the word 'meagesga' has red underline.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
