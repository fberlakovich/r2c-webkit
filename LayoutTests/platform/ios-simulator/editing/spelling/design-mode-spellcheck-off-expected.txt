FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
This tests whether WebKit does not spell check in 'designMode' when spellcheck='false'. To test manually, click arround 'asdf'. There should be no spelling marker for 'asdf' after the click.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS internals.hasSpellingMarker(0, 4) became false
document.body.setAttribute("spellcheck", "true")
asdf is misspelled.
