FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
Spell check suggestions should not be populated when user selects a part of misspelling. To test manually, type 'wellcome home.' select 'llco', and context-click on the selection. The test suceeds when the context menu has no spell check suggestions.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


wellcome home.
