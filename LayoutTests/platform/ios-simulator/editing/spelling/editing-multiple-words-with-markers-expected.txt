FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
The test verifies if the spelling markers disappear when the multiple misspelled words are concatenated by delete command. To test manually, type "it's a meagesga meagesga", then select and delete "esga meag". The test succeeds if the remaining text does not have any underline.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
