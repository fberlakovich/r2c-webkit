FAIL: Timed out waiting for notifyDone to be called
Test if WebKit removes grammar markers when we edit a grammatically-incorrect word. To test manually, press backspace key to delete the last character of "has". This test succeeds when "ha" does not have grammar markers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


document.execCommand("InsertText", false, "You has the right.")
