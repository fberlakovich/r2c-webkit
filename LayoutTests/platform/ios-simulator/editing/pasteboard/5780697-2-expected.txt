This tests for a bug where copying content from a document in quirksmode and pasting it would produce overlapping text because of a height: 1%; overflow: visible; rule. To run manually, paste into a document not in quirksmode. The paragraphs should not overlap. When you inspect the source, the paragraphs should have pixel values for the height property.
