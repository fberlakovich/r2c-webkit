This test opens a new database, then aborts the version change transaction.
It then reopens the database, making sure it's a default, empty database, and changes the version successfully.
It then reopens the database, upgrading it's version. It aborts this versionchange, as well.
Finally it reopens the database again, upgrading its version, making sure things had reverted back to before the second aborted versionchange.
