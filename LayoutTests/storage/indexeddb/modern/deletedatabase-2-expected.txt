This tests that if deleteDatabase is called while there is already an open connection to the database that the open connection gets the appropriate versionChange event.
That open connection also has an in-progress transaction at the time it gets the versionChange event.
Initial upgrade old version - 0 new version - 1
Requesting deleteDatabase
First connection received versionchange event: oldVersion 0, newVersion 0
First version change complete
Delete database success: oldVersion 1, newVersion 0
Recreating database to make sure it's new and empty
Second upgrade old version - 0 new version - 1
Unable to get object store in second upgrade transaction (which is correct because it should not be there)
Second database upgrade success
Done
