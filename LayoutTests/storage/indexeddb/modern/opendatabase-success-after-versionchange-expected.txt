This test verifies that:
- Opening a new database results in the onupgradeneeded handler being called on the IDBOpenDBRequest.
- The versionchange transaction representing the upgrade commits successfully.
- After that transaction commits, the onsuccess handler on the original IDBOpenDBRequest is called.
upgradeneeded: old version - 0 new version - 1
[object IDBTransaction]
Version change complete
Got the onsuccess handler as expected.
Done
