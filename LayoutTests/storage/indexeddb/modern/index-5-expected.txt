This tests creating an index on an object store that already has records, and those records would violate the unique constraint of the index.
(The index creation should fail).
Initial upgrade needed: Old version - 0 New version - 1
Initial upgrade versionchange transaction aborted (expected because index creation failed, and that should've caused transaction abort)
Done
