This tests that if deleteDatabase is called while there is already an open connection to the database that the open connection gets the appropriate versionChange event.
Initial upgrade old version - 0 new version - 1
Version change complete
Requesting deleteDatabase
First connection received versionchange event: oldVersion 1, newVersion null
Delete database success: oldVersion 1, newVersion null
Recreating database to make sure it's new and empty
Second upgrade old version - 0 new version - 1
Unable to get object store in second upgrade transaction (which is correct because it should not be there)
Second database upgrade success
Done
