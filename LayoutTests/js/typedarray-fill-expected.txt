This test checks the behavior of the TypedArray.prototype.fill function

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS Int32Array.prototype.fill.length is 1
PASS Int32Array.prototype.fill.name is 'fill'
PASS isSameFunctionForEachTypedArrayPrototype('fill') is true
PASS testPrototypeReceivesArray('fill', [undefined, this, { }, [ ], true, '']) is true

testPrototypeFunction has the following arg list (name, args, init, result [ , expectedArray ])
