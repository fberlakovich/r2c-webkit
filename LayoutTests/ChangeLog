        Update test and test results. Add "will-transform: transform" to more strongly hint
        to the engine to create a compositing layer for the overlapping element in the
        composting sub-test.

        Make sure the test calls testRunner.waitUntilDone() synchronously when loaded instead
        of doing it later on only when returning from the back/forward cache. Also, trigger
        the navigation in a setTimeout(0) in the load event and rely on the
        page-cache-helper.html like other back/forward cache tests do.

        Fix failing legacy CSP tests by converting them to modern tests instead.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210310

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Convert these tests from verifying the (now removed) X-WebKit-CSP
        header to the modern Content-Security-Policy header.  Since we
        don't have equivalent tests for the modern CSP header and it's not
        very useful to have tons of tests for a feature we no longer
        support.
