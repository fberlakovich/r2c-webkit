        Unreviewed GTK+ gardening. Rebaseline http/tests/inspector/network/fetch-response-body.html/xhr-response-body.html after r214338.

        We are now getting the right application/json for a file data.json. The soup network backend tries to gess the
        mime type from the extension when sniffing is not allowed and the mime type is not known. See bug
        webkit.org/b/168299, that was added actually to fix these tests, but at that time we also failed to guess the
        mime type and returned application/octet-stream.
