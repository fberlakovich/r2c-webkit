        Add the baseline implementation of :not(selectorList)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137548

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        There are 3 big kind of changes to the tests:
        1) The new implementation intentionally breaks :not() of :visited and :link.
           Some test for the basic :not(:link) and :not(:visited) are consequently failing.
        2) Some tests were ensuring that :not() only support simple selectors, those are
           becoming irrelevant.
        3) New test for the feature.

        * TestExpectations:
        This patch intentionally breaks :not(:link). The test fast/history/link-inside-not.html
        time out since it is waiting for the link to match.

        * fast/css/invalid-not-with-simple-selector-sequence-expected.txt: Removed.
        * fast/css/invalid-not-with-simple-selector-sequence.html: Removed.
        This test originally came from IEtestcenter. None of it is useful, all the "invalid"
        cases are now fully functional selectors.

        Parsing of :not(). A lot of them were inspired by Yusuke Suzuki's test suite
        for :matches(). A lot of test case apply to :not(), the main difference is that
        pseudo elements must fail inside :not().
