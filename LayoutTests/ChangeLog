        Unexpected word wrapping for wrapped content then raw content.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121130

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        When deciding whether a line is considered empty, we need to check if the current
        object is fully responsible for the currently uncommitted width. It helps differentiating
        <span></span><span>abcd</span> from <span>a</span><span>bcd</span>, where in the first
        case when we hit the second <span> the line is still considered empty, as opposed to the
        second example.

        Added a new test case to check bad grid items resolution with two
        opposite span positions. Also added a real grid container to check
        also the resolution code path in some other tests.
