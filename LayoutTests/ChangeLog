        Add support for the column-fill property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117693

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        With column-fill support, a lot of multicol tests needed an update.
        The old implementation behaved as if column-fill were 'auto', but the
        initial value is 'balance', so now we need to be explicit about that.
        For auto-height tests it doesn't really matter - such multicols are always
        balanced anyway.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        When deciding whether a line is considered empty, we need to check if the current
        object is fully responsible for the currently uncommitted width. It helps differentiating
        <span></span><span>abcd</span> from <span>a</span><span>bcd</span>, where in the first
        case when we hit the second <span> the line is still considered empty, as opposed to the
        second example.
