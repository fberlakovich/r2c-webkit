        Fix failing legacy CSP tests by converting them to modern tests instead.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210310

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Convert these tests from verifying the (now removed) X-WebKit-CSP
        header to the modern Content-Security-Policy header.  Since we
        don't have equivalent tests for the modern CSP header and it's not
        very useful to have tons of tests for a feature we no longer
        support.
