PASS startTime of a newly created (play-pending) animation is unresolved 
FAIL startTime of a newly created (pause-pending) animation is unresolved undefined is not an object (evaluating 'animation.startTime')
PASS startTime is resolved when running 
FAIL startTime is unresolved when paused undefined is not an object (evaluating 'animation.ready')
PASS startTime while pause-pending and play-pending 
PASS startTime while play-pending from finished state 
PASS startTime while play-pending from finished state using finish() 
FAIL Pausing should make the startTime become null assert_true: After the animation has started, startTime is greater than the time when it was started expected true got false
PASS Sanity test to check round-tripping assigning to a new animation's startTime 
PASS Skipping forward through animation 
PASS Skipping backwards through animation

PASS Setting startTime to null 
FAIL Animation.startTime after pausing assert_equals: Animation.playState is "paused" after pause() call expected "paused" but got "running"
PASS Animation.startTime after cancelling
