        Ensure fetch event promise is resolved in case cache is used.
        Ensure each cache entry is deleted to not hit any cache quota error.
        Test was previously deleting the whole cache, but in WebKit, the quota
        in such a case will only be updated when the cache is garbaged collected, which is not deterministic.
        Make tests output more results to improve debugability.

        Updated referrer computation since it should be done based on the fetch context and not its parent context.
