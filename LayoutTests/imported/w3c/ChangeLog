        Capturing event listeners are called during bubbling phase for shadow hosts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174288

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        * web-platform-tests/dom/events/Event-dispatch-handlers-changed-expected.txt: Rebaselined. This test's
        expectation is now wrong because event listner 3 is added after the event listener list is cloned for
        capturing event listeners but before cloned for bubbling event listeners. As a result, event listener 3
        is now invoked. It used to be not called because both bubbling and capturing event listeners are called
        after cloning the event listner list once, which didn't have event listener 3.

        * web-platform-tests/dom/events/EventTarget-dispatchEvent-expected.txt: Rebaselined. This test expects
        event listener 2, which is bubbling, to be called between two capturing event listeners 1 and 3, which
        is no longer true after this patch.
