FAIL Test animating discrete values assert_equals: Animation produces 'from' value just before the middle of the interval expected "normal" but got "oblique 9.75deg"
PASS Test discrete animation is used when interpolation fails 
PASS Test discrete animation is used only for pairs of values that cannot be interpolated 
FAIL Test the 50% switch point for discrete animation is based on the effect easing assert_equals: Animation produces 'from' value at 94% of the iteration time expected "normal" but got "oblique 8.5deg"
FAIL Test the 50% switch point for discrete animation is based on the keyframe easing assert_equals: Animation produces 'from' value at 94% of the iteration time expected "normal" but got "oblique 8.5deg"
