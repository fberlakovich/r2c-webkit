FAIL Test pointer capture event route across the same-origin frame: Mouse down at inner frame and set pointer capture. assert_array_equals: Received events: innerFrame received pointermove,innerFrame received pointerdown,innerFrame received gotpointercapture,innerFrame received pointermove,innerFrameDocument received pointermove,innerFrameDocument received pointerup,innerFrame received lostpointercapture property 4, expected "innerFrame received pointermove" but got "innerFrameDocument received pointermove"
FAIL Test pointer capture event route across the same-origin frame: Mouse down at outer frame body and set pointer capture. assert_array_equals: Received events: outerFrame received pointermove,outerFrame received pointerdown,outerFrame received gotpointercapture,outerFrame received pointermove,innerFrame received pointerup,outerFrame received lostpointercapture property 4, expected "outerFrame received pointerup" but got "innerFrame received pointerup"
FAIL Test pointer capture event route across the same-origin frame: Mouse down with set capture at inner frame, then release on next mouse move. assert_array_equals: Received events: innerFrame received pointermove,innerFrame received pointerdown,innerFrame received gotpointercapture,innerFrame received pointermove,innerFrame received lostpointercapture,innerFrameDocument received pointermove,outerFrame received pointermove,outerFrame received pointerup lengths differ, expected 7 got 8
PASS Test pointercapture event route across the same-origin frame: Mouse down with set capture at outer frame, then release on next mouse move.
