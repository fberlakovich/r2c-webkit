Implementers looking to fix bugs might want to use the original version of this suite's test framework, which conveniently aggregates similar errors and only reports failures. This file is (part of) the authoritative conformance test suite, and is suitable for incorporation into automated test suites.

(Note: missing tests for types tokenlist, settable tokenlist.)
