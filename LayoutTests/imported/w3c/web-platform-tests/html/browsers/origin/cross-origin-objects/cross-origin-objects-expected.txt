PASS Basic sanity-checking 
PASS Only whitelisted properties are accessible cross-origin 
PASS [[GetPrototypeOf]] should return null 
PASS [[SetPrototypeOf]] should return false 
PASS [[IsExtensible]] should return true for cross-origin objects 
PASS [[PreventExtensions]] should throw for cross-origin objects 
PASS [[GetOwnProperty]] - Properties on cross-origin objects should be reported |own| 
FAIL [[GetOwnProperty]] - Property descriptors for cross-origin properties should be set up correctly assert_equals: property descriptor for 0 should be enumerable expected true but got false
PASS [[Delete]] Should throw on cross-origin objects 
PASS [[DefineOwnProperty]] Should throw for cross-origin objects 
FAIL Can only enumerate safelisted properties assert_equals: Enumerate all safelisted cross-origin Window properties expected 15 but got 0
FAIL [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should return all properties from cross-origin objects assert_array_equals: Object.keys() gives the right answer for cross-origin Window lengths differ, expected 15 got 0
PASS [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should return the right symbol-named properties for cross-origin objects 
PASS [[OwnPropertyKeys]] should place the symbols after the property names after the subframe indices 
PASS A and B jointly observe the same identity for cross-origin Window and Location 
PASS Cross-origin functions get local Function.prototype 
PASS Cross-origin Window accessors get local Function.prototype 
PASS Same-origin observers get different functions for cross-origin objects 
PASS Same-origin observers get different accessors for cross-origin Window 
PASS Same-origin observers get different accessors for cross-origin Location 
PASS {}.toString.call() does the right thing on cross-origin objects
