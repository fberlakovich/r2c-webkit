Basic Behavior test for PerformanceObserver APIs.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Inside PerformanceObserver callback
PASS argumentsLength === 2 is true
PASS list instanceof PerformanceObserverEntryList is true
PASS obs instanceof PerformanceObserver is true
PASS obs === observer is true
FAIL thisObject instanceof PerformanceObserver should be true. Was false.
FAIL thisObject === observer should be true. Was false.
