PASS key.extractable is true
PASS key.algorithm.name is 'hmac'
PASS key.algorithm.length is 0
PASS key.algorithm.hash.name is 'sha-1'
PASS key.usages is ['sign', 'verify']
Using the key to sign 'foo'...
PASS byteArrayToHexString(new Uint8Array(signature)) is '[a3 cc 77 0f c0 33 e2 cb 41 9d 42 b6 4e 00 81 a3 bd 3b e3 0e]'
