Bug 98474: Throttle DOM timers on hidden pages.

TEST COMPLETE
This test measures the time taken to fire a 10ms DOM Timer when the page visibility is set to "visible", "hidden" and then back to "visible". Due to hidden page timer throttling, the timer should fire close to s when page is hidden. And it should fire close to 10ms, when the page is visible.
