Tests that getClientRects(), getBoundingClientRect() return the same result regardless of whether text is selected or not.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".



Before selection:
PASS range.getClientRects().length is 2
FAIL JSON.stringify(range.getClientRects()[0]) should be {"x":163,"y":8,"width":0,"height":18,"top":8,"right":163,"bottom":26,"left":163}. Was {"x":163.953125,"y":8,"width":0,"height":18,"top":8,"right":163.953125,"bottom":26,"left":163.953125}.
FAIL JSON.stringify(range.getClientRects()[1]) should be {"x":8,"y":26,"width":29,"height":18,"top":26,"right":37,"bottom":44,"left":8}. Was {"x":8,"y":26,"width":28.453125,"height":18,"top":26,"right":36.453125,"bottom":44,"left":8}.
FAIL JSON.stringify(range.getBoundingClientRect()) should be {"x":8,"y":8,"width":155,"height":36,"top":8,"right":163,"bottom":44,"left":8}. Was {"x":8,"y":8,"width":155.953125,"height":36,"top":8,"right":163.953125,"bottom":44,"left":8}.
