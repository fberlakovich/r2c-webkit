        font shorthand should accept variation values
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168998

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The CSS Fonts 4 spec has stabilized as to which variation values are allowed in
        the font shorthand property. Weights are allowed because a 0 weight is considered
        as a parse error, so there is no conflict with a unitless font-size of 0.
        font-style accepts angles, so there is no conflict there. However, font-stretch
        accepts percentages, which are also accepted by font-size, which means the newly
        extended grammar for font-stretch can't be accepted in the shorthand.

        SVG animations are not paused when inserted into a hidden page
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170026
        <rdar://problem/31228704>

        SVG animations were not paused when inserted into a hidden page. We would pause
        animations in a page when the page becomes hidden. However, new animations
        inserted in the page after this point would start, despite the page being
        hidden.
