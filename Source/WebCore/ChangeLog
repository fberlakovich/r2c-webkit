        [Cocoa] REGRESSION(r244182): Inspector thinks CA commits can be nested
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198497

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        WebInspecter should coalesce nested composites as one recorded composite.
        This can be done by ensuring that we only process CA preCommit and postCommit
        once per nested commits.

        * inspector/InspectorController.cpp:
        (WebCore::InspectorController::willComposite):
        * inspector/InspectorController.h:
        Export willComposite(). We want to call willComposite()/ didComposite()
        from CA preCommit and postCommit handlers in flushLayers().

        * inspector/agents/InspectorTimelineAgent.cpp:
        (WebCore::InspectorTimelineAgent::didComposite):
        Unrelated change: didComposite() should not assert that we're in the middle
        of a composite. Web Inspector may connect in the middle of a composite.

        * page/FrameView.cpp:
        (WebCore::FrameView::flushCompositingStateIncludingSubframes):
        InspectorController::willComposite() will be called form CA preCommit
        handler of flushLayers().

        [WHLSL] Educate the property resolver about IndexExpressions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198399

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This is part one of two patches which will allow buffers to work. This patch
        adds support in the property resolver for index expressions. Index expressions
        get turned into calls to "getter indexers", "setter indexers", or "ander
        indexers". They work almost identically to dot expressions, except there is an
        extra "index" expression which gets turned into an extra argument to those
        functions.

        There's actually a bit of a trick here. Let's say we need to run a getter and
        a setter separately (e.g. "foo[3]++;"). The index expression can't be duplicated
        for both the getter and the setter (e.g. the functions are
        int operator[](Foo, uint) and Foo operator[]=(Foo, uint, int), and we aren't
        allowed to execute the index expression multiple times. Consider if that "3"
        in the example is actually "bar()" with some side effect. So, we have to run
        the index expression once at the correct time, and save its result to a temporary
        variable, and then pass in the temporary variable into the getter and setter.

        So, if the code says "foo[bar()][baz()] = quux();" the following sequence of
        functions get run:

        - bar()
        - operator[](Foo, uint)
        - baz()
        - quux()
        - operator[]=(OtherType, uint, OtherOtherType)
        - operator[]=(Foo, uint, OtherType)

        The next patch will modify the WebGPU JavaScript implementation to send buffer
        lengths to the shader, and for the shader compiler to correctly unpack this
        information and place it inside the array references. That should be everything
        that's needed to get buffers to work. After that, hooking up compute should be
        fairly trivial.

        [WHLSL] Parsing and lexing the standard library is slow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192890
        <rdar://problem/50746335>

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        The main idea is to avoid backtracking by instead peeking at the next token (and occasionally at the one after that).
        This implies a few things:
        - We can replace the stack of tokens by a trivial ring buffer of size 2 (holding the next token and the one after, or WTF::nullopt if we are at the end of the file).
        - We now have "completeFooExpression" functions, to avoid having to reparse the prefix of some expression, if we find half-way through what it is.

        I also fixed the following parser bug:
        - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198305 [WHLSL] Multiple variables with initializers in a declaration statement crashes the compiler
            which was due to a mistake I made in the grammar

        Finally I added two new macros: CONSUME_TYPE and PARSE to eliminate about 500 lines of error propagation boilerplate.

        There are still lots of ways of improving the parser and lexer, such as:
        - finishing the conversion of tokens in the lexer, not bothering with allocating string views
        - make two special tokens Invalid and EOF, to remove the overhead of Optional
        - make peekTypes and consumeTypes use templates to avoid constructing a Vector and calling find on it.
        - Turn the entire lexer into a proper automata, not going through the same characters again and again (this is certainly the largest win by far)
        - Remove the last few pieces of backtracking from the parser.

        The current patch is already enough to make parsing the full standard library (something like 85k lines) approximately 260ms.
        This is still longer than I would like, but nowhere near the bottleneck any longer because of some other parts of the compiler.
