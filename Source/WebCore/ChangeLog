        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyEC::keySizeInBits(), ::platformGeneratePair()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170345

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Start implementing the libgcrypt-based platform bits of CryptoKeyEC.

        Implement keySizeInBits() by returning the appropriate size for this
        object's curve type. An assertion is added to ensure that this size
        matches the one that's returned by gcry_pk_get_nbits() for this
        object's EC key as represented by the m_platformKey gcry_sexp_t object.

        Implement platformGeneratePair() by constructing a genkey s-expression
        that requests a generation of an EC key for the specified curve type.
        The s-expression is then passed to gcry_pk_genkey(), and the public
        and private key data is then retrieved from the returned s-expression
        upon success and used to create the public and private CryptoKeyEC
        objects.

        The PlatformECKey type alias is changed to match gcry_sexp_t. The
        CryptoKeyEC destructor releases the gcry_sexp_t object through
        a PAL::GCrypt::HandleDeleter<gcry_sexp_t> instance.

        The method definitions in the CryptoKeyECGCrypt.cpp file are also
        sorted to match the declaration order in the header.

        No new tests -- current ones cover this sufficiently, but are not yet
        enabled due to other missing platform-specific SUBTLE_CRYPTO

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170245

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

        While searching for mid-word break, we measure the text by codepoints in a loop until the accumulated width > available width.
        When we see that the accumulated width for the individual codepoints overflows, we join the codepoints and re-measure them.
        These 2 widths could be considerably different for number of reasons (ligatures is a prime example). When we figure that
        the run still fits, we go back to the main loop (since we are not supposed to wrap the line here) and take the next codepoint.
        However this time we start the measurement from the last whitespace, so we end up remeasuring a potentially long chuck of text
        until we hit the wrapping point. This is way too expensive.
        This patch changes the logic so that we just go back to measuring individual codepoints until we hit the constrain again.  

        Covered by existing tests.

        function was on Element but this prevented AudioContext from registering

        There are two instances where nodes are registered as touch event handlers without
        having normal touch event listeners: slider thumb elements, and elements with overflow scrolling,
        on iOS.

        For such nodes, hasEventTargetData() will be false, but we want to ensure
        that they are removed from the Document's touchEventHandler set, so move the
        call to document.removeTouchEventHandler() outside of the conditional block.

        from a "Have Metadata" to a "Future Data" state that causes playback to begin, however, we never check

        REGRESSION (r213764): Background image from sprite sheet incorrectly scaled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169547

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The bug happens when drawing only a rectangle of an image not the whole
        image. In BitmapImage::draw(), sizeForDrawing was calculated as the destRect
        scaled by the transformation which is applied to the GraphicsContext. Two
        problems with this approach. The first one is destRect can be only part of
        the image. The second problem is, the ratio destRect / srcRect is another
        scaling that needs to be considered.

        To fix this issue, first the base size has to be size of the image and not
        destRect.size(). Secondly, we need to scale this base size with the context
        transformation multiplied by the ratio destRect / srcRect. This scaling is
        exactly the same scaling which is calculated in subsamplingScale(). Finally
        we use this scaled size as the sizeForDrawing to send to the ImageDecoder.

        [css-align] Adapt content-alignment properties to the new baseline syntax
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170262

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The baseline-position syntax has changed recently, so we need to update
        the CSS properties using the old syntax. This patch address only the
        content-alignment (align-content and justify-content).

        I used this patch to adapt the implementation of the parsing logic for
        these properties to the new Blink's CSS Parsing Design.

        The new baseline syntax is "[first | last ]? baseline" which implies
        modifying the parsing and computed value logic.

        There are several layout tests affected by this change, so I'll update
        them accordingly.

        No new tests, just added/modified some cases to the tests we
        already have using the new baseline values.

        [css-grid] Clamp the number of autorepeat tracks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170120

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        As suggested by the specs we do clamp the maximum number of tracks per grid in order to
        minimize potential OOM situations. However we were not considering the case of the recently
        added auto repeat syntax. Abnormally huge values for the width/height on the grid container
        could lead to a number of auto repeat tracks higher than the maximum.

        A new API was added to Internals in order to test limits without having to create huge
        grids. This new API allows clients to set an arbitrary limit to the number of tracks. The
        addition of this new API forced us to add GridPosition.cpp to the project to define the
        global variable we use for testing. We took the chance to move part of the implementation
        from the header file to the source file.

        Last but not least, several new ASSERTs were added to Grid.cpp implementation to ensure that
        we do not surpass the grid track limits.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        TrueType GX-style variation fonts use one particular scale for values on their
        weight/width/slope axes - usually the values lie between -1 and 1 on that scale.
        However, OpenType 1.8-style fonts use the CSS scale for values on these axes.
        For the purposes of font selection, these values need to lie on the same scale.
        However, when font selection is completed and the variation values are actually
        being applied to the fonts, values which lie on the font's actual scale need to
        be applied. This patch adds normalize*() and denormalize*() functions to perform
        both of these operations. 

        The conversion itself between the two scales isn't an exact mapping. Mapping
        slope is just a linear relationship with 0deg <=> 0 and 20deg <=> 1 (as per the
        CSS Fonts spec). Mapping widths is similar, it uses a 2-component piecewise
        linear relationship which includes the values given in the Microsoft OpenType
        spec for the OS/2 table's usWidthClass field. Weights are more difficult, so I
        plotted the CSS weights and the GX-style weights for every style of San
        Francisco, saw that the relationship appears to be linear, and ran a linear
        regression to compute the line equation.

        As for the actual discrimination of determining whether a font is a GX-style
        font or not, we can use the presence of the 'STAT' table. This table didn't
        exist when GX fonts were being created, and OpenType 1.8 variable fonts are
        required to have this table.

        Facebook uses the string ".SFNSText" in their @font-face blocks. This font is
        a variation font, but uses the GX-style values. Facebook asks us to create

        [css-align] Adapt self-alignment properties to the new baseline syntax
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170235

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The baseline-position syntax has changed recently, so we need to update
        the CSS properties using the old syntax. This patch address only the
        self-alignment (align-self and justify-self) and default-alignment
        (align-items and justify-items).

        The content-distribution properties (align-content and justify-content)
        will be updated in a follow up patch.

        The new baseline syntax is "[first | last ]? baseline" which implies
        modifying the parsing and computed value logic.

        There are several layout tests affected by this change, so I'll update
        them accordingly.

        No new tests, just added/modified some cases to the tests we already have using the new baseline values.

        Animated SVG images are not paused in pages loaded in the background
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170043
        <rdar://problem/31234412>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Animated SVG images are not paused in pages loaded in the background. We rely
        on FrameView::isOffscreen() to stop images animations in background tab (See
        logic in RenderElement's shouldRepaintForImageAnimation()). This works fine
        if a tab is visble and then becomes hidden (i.e. by switching to another
        tab). However, in the case where the tab gets loaded while in the background
        (e.g. opening link in new background tab, or session restore), then the
        animations would not be paused, due to FrameView::isOffscreen() erroneously
        returning false in this case.

        Normally, the following chain of events happens:
        - Page is visible, we construct a main frame and its FrameView for loading
          the page. When a FrameView is constructed, we call FrameView::show() to
          make it visible. Then, if the page becomes non-visible, we call
          Page::setIsVisibleInternal(false) which calls FrameView::hide(). After
          that, FrameView::isOffscreen() correctly returns true because we properly
          called FrameView::hide().

        However, when doing a load while the Page is hidden, the following was
        happening:
        - Page is not visible, we call Page::setIsVisibleInternal(false) which tries
          to call FrameView::hide() for the main frame but it does not have a FrameView
          yet (because the load has not started). We start the load and end up creating
          a FrameView. The FrameView constructor was calling FrameView::show()
          unconditionally, thus making the FrameView think is visible, even though its
          page isn't. At this point, FrameView::isOffscreen() was returning false
          and animations would keep running, even though the page is not visible.

        To address the issue, we now call FrameView::show() in FrameView::create() only
        if the Page is actually visible, instead of calling it unconditionally. If the
        page ever becomes visible, Page::setIsVisibleInternal(true) will be called and
        it will take care of calling FrameView::show() then.

        [Modern Media Controls] Controls bar may disappear while captions menu is visible (redux)

        <rdar://problem/31320685>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We did some work in webkit.org/b/168751 to prevent the controls bar from disappearing while the
        captions menu is visible. But there were two cases where the behavior was not as intended:

            1. the controls bar would hide upon exiting the video.
            2. clicking on the controls bar while the caption panel is up would hide the controls bar
               as well as the captions panel.

        Instead of determining that the "userInteractionEnabled" property being set to "false" is indicative
        of secondary UI, such as the tracks panel, being attached to the controls bar, we now have an
        explicit property to specify this. Now, when "hasSecondaryUIAttached" is "true", we prevent the
        controls bar from fading when exiting the media.

        Additionally, when dismissing the tracks panel, we check whether a mouse event lead to this and check
        if the mouse was positioned over the controls bar. If that is the case, we no longer hide the controls
        bar and only dismiss the tracks panel.

        gain = 0; just zero out the output.  Currently, the input is
        multiplied by the gain to produce the output.  This just optimizes the
        multiplication away for the two special cases.

        Also, have the GainNode set the silence hint if the gain is 0.

        And fix a bug in processIfNecessary when unsilenceOutputs was causing the
        silence hint to be cleared after the node's process method was finished
        and may have set the silence hint.  The processing should come after
        unsilenceOutputs to preserve any hints from processing the node.

        Animated SVG images are not paused when outside viewport

        There were a variety of issues with media documents, some longstanding, and some specifically
        about modern media controls.

        One issue was that fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons would show for audio media documents,
        due to using a <video> element to load the audio file. We now have additional logic in MediaController
        to identify if the loaded media is really an audio file, and using this information to hide the
        fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons.

        Another issue was that we would inject style in MediaDocument.cpp that was specific to modern media
        controls when we could have the modern-media-controls module injected CSS handle this styling. We now
        use the injected style in the shadow root to size media documents based on the device characteristics
        and ensuring that page styles are overridden.

        We also simplify how MediaDocument.cpp sets the source of the media element to simply use the "src"
        attribute and not a <source> element.

        Finally, we introduce a MediaDocumentController class that is instantiated when we're dealing with
        a media document to hide the controls while we determine the type of media we're loading (audio vs.
        video) in order to apply the appropriate styling without flashes.

        As a result of the new styles applied by the modern-media-controls module, media documents have a
        similar behavior on macOS and iPad, where we only enforce a min-width for video allowing them
        to play at their natural size otherwise, and enforcing a fixed width for audio. On iPhone however,
        we want to always play the media at full width, with some padding in the case of audio.

        REGRESSION(213764): Large images should not be decoded asynchronously when they are drawn on a canvas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169771

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Sometimes we have to draw the image immediately like when a canvas calls  
        drawImage. In this case we have to decode the image synchronously to guarantee
        the drawing. Other times we need to decode with the native size of the image.
        The animated images have to be decoded with native size always. Otherwise
        the frame cache will be messed up if the same image is animated with different
        sizes. Currently we always decode asynchronously with sizeForDrawing. We need
        to decouple the decoding mode from the sizeForDrawing.

        This patch introduce the DecodingOptions class which can store and compare the
        following four cases:
            -- Synchronous: The frame has be decoded with native size only.
            -- Asynchronous + anySize: This is passed from the Image::draw() callers.
            -- Asynchronous + fullSize: The image has to be decoded with its full size.
            -- Asynchronous + sizeForDrawing: The image can be decoded with sizeForDrawing unless
            it was decoded with either a full size or sizeForDrawing which is larger than the

        Allow the page to render before <link> stylesheet tags in body
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149157
        <rdar://problem/24658830>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Currently we block style and renderer building completely if document has any loading
        stylesheets. In case a script queries something layout dependent we construct the render
        tree with whatever style we have but block painting in it.

        This patch changes behavior so that a loading stylesheet in body only blocks rendering for elements
        that are after it. The expectation is that such stylesheets rarely affect elements before them
        and the elements can be rendered without causing ugly visible styling changes.

        The patch replaces the old flash-of-unstyled-content (FOUC) preventation mechanism with a more
        fine-grained one. Paint blocking is now done on per-renderer basis with based on isNonFinal flag in
        RenderStyle.

        For stylesheets in head the behavior should be largely unchanged.

        gets rid of this odd case where the content would not see the "click" event while the C++ side would
        handle it and pause the video.

        [Modern Media Controls] Improve media documents across macOS, iPhone and iPad
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169145
        <rdar://problem/17048858>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        There were a variety of issues with media documents, some longstanding, and some specifically
        about modern media controls.

        One issue was that fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons would show for audio media documents,
        due to using a <video> element to load the audio file. We now have additional logic in MediaController
        to identify if the loaded media is really an audio file, and using this information to hide the
        fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons.

        Another issue was that we would inject style in MediaDocument.cpp that was specific to modern media
        controls when we could have the modern-media-controls module injected CSS handle this styling. We now
        use the injected style in the shadow root to size media documents based on the device characteristics
        and ensuring that page styles are overridden.

        We also simplify how MediaDocument.cpp sets the source of the media element to simply use the "src"
        attribute and not a <source> element.

        Finally, we introduce a MediaDocumentController class that is instantiated when we're dealing with
        a media document to hide the controls while we determine the type of media we're loading (audio vs.
        video) in order to apply the appropriate styling without flashes.

        As a result of the new styles applied by the modern-media-controls module, media documents have a
        similar behavior on macOS and iPad, where we only enforce a min-width for video allowing them
        to play at their natural size otherwise, and enforcing a fixed width for audio. On iPhone however,
        we want to always play the media at full width, with some padding in the case of audio.

        The video header on zillow.com would pause when switching to another tab after r214195. On
        switching back to the zillow.com tab, we would resume the video but fail to take the poster
        away, making it look like the video is still paused.

        We normally take the poster away when HTMLMediaElement::mediaPlayerFirstVideoFrameAvailable()
        is called. However, mediaPlayerFirstVideoFrameAvailable() was only ever called once because of
        the m_haveReportedFirstVideoFrame flag in MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundation::updateStates().
        We now reset m_haveReportedFirstVideoFrame to false in updateStates() if hasAvailableVideoFrame()
        return false, so that we call mediaPlayerFirstVideoFrameAvailable() again when the return
        value of asAvailableVideoFrame() becomes true again (e.g. after the media session interruption

        Reduce the scope of code that should never dispatch DOM events so as to allow updating contents size
        after restoring a page from the page cache.

        In r214014 we instantiate a NoEventDispatchAssertion in FrameLoader::commitProvisionalLoad()
        around the call to CachedPage::restore() to assert when a DOM event is dispatched during
        page restoration as such events can cause re-entrancy into the page cache. As it turns out
        it is sufficient to ensure that no DOM events are dispatched after restoring all cached frames
        as opposed to after CachedPage::restore() returns.

        Also rename Document::enqueue{Pageshow, Popstate}Event() to dispatch{Pageshow, Popstate}Event(),
        respectively, since they synchronously dispatch events :(. We hope in the future to make them
        asynchronously dispatch events.

        [Modern Media Controls] Remove placard icon if height is compressed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167935
        <rdar://problem/30397128>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We make the addition of certain Placard children conditional on the placard's metrics. Whenever the
        media controls metrics changes, the placard, if any, is set to have the same metrics and layout() is
        called where we ensure that there is enough space, per designs, to have the icon, description and even
        the title visible. We also make some CSS improvements to guarantee that the description is laid out on
        two lines at most and that both text labels are trimmed elegantly with an ellipsis shold the width be
        insufficient to display the whole text.

        Since we would have needed to have more width/height setter overrides to trigger layout, we now make
        LayoutNode trigger layout() directly and remove the need for subclasses to do this on a per-class basis.
        We also make layout() a method that can be called safely anytime as it's now no longer part of the DOM
        commit step, a new commit() method is used instead of that.

        When testing content extensions, we have always called an API function that internally
        has called AtomicString::init somewhere before we start compiling the content extension.
        On iOS, though, we call [_WKUserContentExtensionStore compileContentExtensionForIdentifier:...]
        without having already called anything that calls AtomicString::init.  The new CSS parser is now
        failing to parse some selectors because CSSSelectorParser::defaultNamespace is returning starAtom,
        which is a null atomic string before AtomicString::init is called.

        Covered by a new API test.

        Replacing tracks will always succeed for audio sources.
        For video tracks, it will only succeed if the video resolution is not greater.
        LibWebRTCPeerConnectionBackend will delegate the track replacing by replacing the source of the outgoing sources with the source wrapped in the replacing track.

        Video test is not fully passing as size constraints for mock video sources are not providing the right video stream resolution.

        since r214338, the content type is known and inferred from the extension in this case, what ends up calling

        font shorthand should accept variation values
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168998

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The CSS Fonts 4 spec has stabilized as to which variation values are allowed in
        the font shorthand property. Weights are allowed because a 0 weight is considered
        as a parse error, so there is no conflict with a unitless font-size of 0.
        font-style accepts angles, so there is no conflict there. However, font-stretch
        accepts percentages, which are also accepted by font-size, which means the newly
        extended grammar for font-stretch can't be accepted in the shorthand.
