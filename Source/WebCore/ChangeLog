        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        This crash happened when the default checked setter was called for an input element and RadioButtonGroup was NULL.
        Added condition to dereference the group only if it is non-null.

        If selectionForParagraphIteration returns a non-range selection, there is no need for finding
        multiple paragraphs. And since non-range selection is handled, the assertion can be removed.

        Style sharing optimization was unconditionally allowed for elements that were styled with part pseudo element.
        This could lead to miscomputed style.
