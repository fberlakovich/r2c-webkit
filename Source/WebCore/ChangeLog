        SVG animations were not paused when inserted into a hidden page. We would pause
        animations in a page when the page becomes hidden. However, new animations
        inserted in the page after this point would start, despite the page being
        hidden.

        Tests:
        - svg/animations/animations-paused-when-inserted-in-hidden-document.html
        - svg/animations/animations-paused-when-inserted-in-hidden-document2.html
