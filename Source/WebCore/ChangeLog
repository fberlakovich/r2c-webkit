        Reintroduce PassRefPtr<Event> copy in ScopedEventQueue::dispatchEvent
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122742

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        This is a follow-up to r157219 which introduced a workaround for the GCC's quirky behavior that
        was resulting in crashes due to the PassRefPtr<Event> object passed to EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent
        being copied and nullified first before retrieving the EventTarget of the Event object wrapped in that
        PassRefPtr.

        The implementation is now adjusted to first retrieve the pointer to the Event's EventTarget and store
        it in a local variable. That variable is then passed as the first parameter to EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent,
        and the PassRefPtr<Event> passed directly as the second parameter. Previously the pointer of that PassRefPtr
        object was passed in, with a new PassRefPtr being created which would increase the reference count of the
        ref-counted object. Passing in the original PassRefPtr avoids the unnecessary reference count increase by creating
        a copy. That still nullifies the original PassRefPtr, but that's not a problem anymore.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Implement support for <flex>
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115362

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        From Blink r149134, r149480, r149532, r150287 and r156127 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>
        From Blink r157820 by <svillar@igalia.com>

        Added support for flexible lengths ('fr' unit) in CSS Grid Layout
        code. This requires the addition of GridLength class to
        encapsulate the knowledge of <flex> to the grid layout code.

        Also updated the algorithm that computes the layout. It increases
        the value of 1fr based on the grid tracks' usedBreath to fraction
        ratio (called normalizedFractionValue). This enables increasing
        the fraction value while updating the available space to account
        for processed grid tracks. The algorithm stops when we run out of
        grid tracks or available space (one grid item has an intrinsic
        size too big). This matches the specs to the letter for the known
        available space case (both the unknown case and the interaction
        with 'span' are left out of this patch).
