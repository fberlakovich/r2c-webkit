        [GTK] RenderThemeGtk::platformActiveSelectionBackgroundColor, et. al. should not clobber state of cached GtkStyleContexts

        platformActiveSelectionBackgroundColor(), platformInactiveSelectionBackgroundColor(), etc.
        are const functions intended only to return a color used for painting, but since r174929
        they also change the state of the cached style contexts we use for GTK_TYPE_ENTRY and
        GTK_TYPE_TREE_VIEW. That's wrong; those style contexts should not have any state set. This
        could cause theme colors returned by those GtkStyleContexts to change unexpectedly,
        depending on whether the state is explicitly set before each use, or whether the theme
        actually uses the states.

        This didn't cause any regression only because every place using these style contexts
        explicitly sets the state of the style contexts before use. In fact, the GtkTreeView style
        context is not used anywhere else, and the GtkEntry style context is only used in
        paintTextField, which does set the state before use (and then reverts it using
        save/restore), so this cannot have broken anything in practice. But it's a landmine waiting
        for the next programmer to trip it.

        Fix this with a gtk_style_context_save()/gtk_style_context_restore() pair.

        Tiny cleanup in ComplexTextController::collectComplexTextRuns()

        The isMissingGlyph boolean is completely unnecessary. Its entire
        responsiblity is duplicated by the "font" pointer.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.
