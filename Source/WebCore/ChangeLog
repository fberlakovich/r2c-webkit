        (WebCore::SimpleLineLayout::RunResolver::Run::text): Changed return type to
        StringView to fix the lifetime bug and also to improve performance by getting
        rid of the need to allocate and destroy a StringImpl object.

        [EFL] Call requestScrollPositionUpdate() instead of delegatedScrollRequested() in ScrollView::scrollTo()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137478

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        As r174380 did, ScrollView::scrollTo() also calls requestScrollPositionUpdate() instead of delegatedScrollRequested().
        delegatedScrollRequested() will be only called by requestScrollPositionUpdate(), and it needs to be merged by existing
        other scroll request function.

        No new tests, no behavior changes.

        Safari 8 on OSX 10.10 does not run WebGL in Retina HiDPI mode.

        The NSOpenGLLayer has to have its contentScale property
        set accordingly when on a retina display. Do this by
        adding another value to the GraphicsContext3D creation
        attribute dictionary, representing the device pixel ratio.
        Then, when we come to draw into the layer, make sure
        we set our GL viewport to the correct value.

        This is currently untestable because:
        - we can't just read from the GL buffer as it is always correct
        - WebGL isn't working in reftests
        - a layer dump doesn't show the change since it was done in a CALayer subclass.

        * html/canvas/WebGLRenderingContext.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::create): Pass the devicePixelRatio into the attribute dictionary.
        * platform/graphics/GraphicsContext3D.h:
        (WebCore::GraphicsContext3D::Attributes::Attributes): Add a devicePixelRatio attribute.
        * platform/graphics/mac/WebGLLayer.h: New property to save us looking up the attributes
        each frame.
        * platform/graphics/mac/WebGLLayer.mm:
        (-[WebGLLayer initWithGraphicsContext3D:]): Store the devicePixelRatio, and set our
        contents scale appropriately.
        (-[WebGLLayer drawInCGLContext:pixelFormat:forLayerTime:displayTime:]): Draw into
        a correctly sized backbuffer.
        (-[WebGLLayer copyImageSnapshotWithColorSpace:]): Generate an image of the correct size.
