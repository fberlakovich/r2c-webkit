        * GNUmakefile.am: Set up the libPlatform.la static library to build the source files listed in platform_sources.
        As with the libPlatformGtk.la library, only the Source/WebCore/platform and its subdirectories are allowed to be
        searched for headers to include, providing a convenient way to detect any platform violations. These directories
        are listed in the platform_webcore_cppflags variable.
