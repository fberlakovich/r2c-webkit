        * UIProcess/API/APIContentExtensionStore.cpp:
        (API::ContentExtensionStore::compileContentExtension):
        AtomicString::init must be called for the first time from the main thread.
        We were calling it for the first time from a non-main thread sometimes.
        Call it from the main thread before initiating compiling on another thread.
