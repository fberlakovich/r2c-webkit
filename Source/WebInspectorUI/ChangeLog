        Web Inspector: save Inspector's breakpoints to localStorage whenever they are modified
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151581

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Serialize all breakpoints to the "breakpoints" Setting in local storage
        whenever any breakpoint model object is added, removed, or modified.

        Remove the old listener that attempted to save breakpoints on the
        pagehide event. It did not fire in important scenarios like exiting
        the browser via Cmd-Q or killing the process via Ctrl-C / SIGKILL.

        This is not expected to be a performance problem because most people
        do not keep thousands of breakpoints active, and breakpoints are not
        set very often. If it's a problem, we can mitigate it with coalescing.

        Web Inspector: inspector settings should not be shared between different inspection levels
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151151

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        It's really annoying to have shared settings between Inspector^1 and Inspector^2, because
        they are not designed to respond to external changes to local storage keys. As a result,
        the two inspectors seemingly have different settings while both are open, but the settings
        clobber each other depending on which inspector is closed first. On the next inspector
        being opened, it has settings that reflect whichever inspector closed last.

        To fix this, alter the local storage key prefix to incude the inspection level when it is
        greater than 1 (i.e., inspecting the inspector). The storage prefix becomes
        "com.apple.WebInspector-${inspectionLevel}." in this case.
        This is backwards-compatible for normal Inspector, who keeps the same storage prefix. 

        Alternate approaches that were considered and abandoned:

         - Use separate WKWebSiteDataStores for each inspection level. This API (as it currently is)
        does not support multiple on-disk storage locations. We don't want to add an entirely new
        Library directory for each inspector level, and sharing a single location doesn't fix the
        shared-settings bug. Changing storage location would lose all existing Inspector settings.

         - Sync settings between multiple open Inspectors. This would be catastrophic, as changing
        the active tab on one inspector would immediately propagate to the other open inspectors.
