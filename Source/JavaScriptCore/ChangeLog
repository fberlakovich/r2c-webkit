        Fix compiler warning on noreturn function
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137558

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The function is marked "noreturn", but the stub implementation does
        return. No new tests: function is never called. Only fixes a warning.

        Ensure that inline assembly Thunk functions don't conflict with the section designations of the compiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137434

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        The ARM64 version of the defineUnaryDoubleOpWrapper macro in
        ThunkGenerators.cpp contains inline assembly with .text assembler
        directive followed by a static variable declaration. This macro gets
        expanded several times afterwards, however, only during the compilation
        of the first expansion does gcc insert a .data assembler directive
        before the assembled version of the static variable. Thus, only the
        first variable gets allocated in the .data section, all the others
        remain in .text. If JavaScriptCore is built as a shared library then
        this causes a segmentation fault during dynamic linking.

        This patch puts a .previous directive at the end of the inline assembly
        to ensure that the assumptions of the compiler about the sections are
        not broken and the following variable goes to the right place.

        Make sure arguments tearoff is performed through the environment record if necessary

        Fairly simple change.  If we have a lexical record we need to pull the unmodified
        arguments object from the record and then use the standard op_tear_off_arguments
        instruction on the temporary.
