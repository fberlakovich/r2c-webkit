        Rename JavaScriptCore builtins files to match exposed object names
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151549

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        As a subtask of unifying code generation for WebCore and JSC builtins, we need to get rid of
        differences between builtins filenames (e.g., Promise.prototype.js) and the name of the
        generated Builtin object (PromisePrototype).

        If we don't do this, then both build systems need special hacks to normalize the object name
        from the file name. It's easier to just normalize the filename.

        REGRESSION(r192536): Null pointer dereference in JSPropertyNameEnumerator::visitChildren().
        <https://webkit.org/b/151495>

        The test I added when fixing this bug the first time caught another bug when
        run on 32-bit: jsString() can also cause GC, so we have to make sure that
        JSPropertyNameEnumerator::m_propertyNames is null until after the array it
        points to has been populated.

        Test: property-name-enumerator-gc-151495.js
