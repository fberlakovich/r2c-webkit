        virtualForWithFunction() should not throw an exception with a partially initialized frame.
        <https://webkit.org/b/129134>

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        Currently, when JITOperations.cpp's virtualForWithFunction() fails to
        prepare the callee function for execution, it proceeds to throw the
        exception using the callee frame which is only partially initialized
        thus far. Instead, it should be throwing the exception using the caller
        frame because:
        1. the error happened "in" the caller while preparing the callee for
           execution i.e. the caller frame is the top fully initialized frame
           on the stack.
        2. the callee frame is not fully initialized yet, and the unwind
           mechanism cannot depend on the data in it.

        DefaultGCActivityCallback::doWork() should reschedule if GC is deferred.
        <https://webkit.org/b/129131>

        Reviewed by Mark Hahnenberg.

        Currently, DefaultGCActivityCallback::doWork() does not check if the GC
        needs to be deferred before commencing. As a result, the GC may crash
        and/or corrupt data because the VM is not in the consistent state needed
        for the GC to run. With this fix, doWork() now checks if the GC is
        supposed to be deferred and re-schedules if needed. It only commences
        with GC'ing when it's safe to do so.

        Don't truncate non-int doubles to 0 -- that's just not how ToInt32 works.
        Instead, take a slow path that will do the right thing.

        DFG should do its own static estimates of execution frequency before it starts creating OSR entrypoints

        We estimate execution counts based on loop depth, and then use those to estimate branch
        weights. These weights then get carried all the way down to LLVM prof branch_weights
        meta-data.
        
        This is better than letting LLVM do its own static estimates, since by the time we
        generate LLVM IR, we may have messed up the CFG due to OSR entrypoint creation. Of
        course, it would be even better if we just slurped in some kind of execution counts
        from profiling, but we don't do that, yet.

        It's OK to not have an unwind section, so long as the function also doesn't have any
