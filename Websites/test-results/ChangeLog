        (TestResultsView.setAvailableTests): Added.
        (TestResultsView.showTooltip): Fixed the code to compute x and y coordinates of the tooltip to take

        (TestResultsView.fetchTest): Added the code to show "Loading..." in the pane while loading the JSON.

        (TestResultsView.loadTestsFromLocationHash): Take care of both 'tests' and 'builder' components.
        (fetchManifest): Setup the UI to select a builder.
