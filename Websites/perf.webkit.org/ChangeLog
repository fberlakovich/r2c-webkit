        Cannot trigger Dromaeo tests on internal perf try bots
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179712

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The bug was caused by CustomAnalysisTaskConfigurator only showing the top-level tests that are triggerable
        instead of the list of highest level tests that are triggerable.

        * public/v3/components/custom-analysis-task-configurator.js:
        (CustomAnalysisTaskConfigurator.prototype.selectTests): Update the test group name when a new test is picked.
        (CustomAnalysisTaskConfigurator.prototype.selectPlatform):
        (CustomAnalysisTaskConfigurator.prototype._didUpdateSelectedPlatforms): Extracted from selectPlatform.
        (CustomAnalysisTaskConfigurator.prototype._renderTriggerableTests): Include the list of all highest-level tests
        which are triggerable.
        (CustomAnalysisTaskConfigurator.prototype._renderRadioButtonList): Added labelForObject which returns the label
        to be used in the list items. For tests, we want to use the full name, not just its label.
        * public/v3/models/analysis-task.js:
        (AnalysisTask.fetchById):
        * public/v3/models/triggerable.js:
        (Triggerable.prototype.acceptedTests): Added.
        (Triggerable.prototype.acceptsTest): Deleted.
