        Fix the bug that 'TestGroupResultsViewer' creates unnecessary rows.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181967

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Fixed a bug caused by a typo in CommitSet.equals, which makes it returns incorrect results for most
        comparison between a CommitSet and a MeasurementCommitSet.

        MeasurementCommitSet does not have full information for the commits, thus, it cannot build mappings
        between root/patch/owner commit/requires build to repository. When querying whether a given repository
        needs to be built, MeasurementCommitSet will return undefined. Due to 'undefined != false', this
        equality check will fail. Making 'CommitSet.requiresBuildForRepository' defaults to 'false' would fix
        this bug.

        * public/v3/models/commit-set.js:
        (CommitSet.prototype.requiresBuildForRepository): Make it return false when key does not exist
        instead of 'undefined'.
        (CommitSet.prototype.equals): Fixed the typo that causes the bug.
        Use wrapped functions instead of querying the mapping directly.
        * unit-tests/commit-set-tests.js: Added unit tests.

        Extend 'ifBuilt' config key to set property based on whether certain repositories are built or not.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181906

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Before this change, 'ifBuilt' will always set specified property for test properties as long as there
        is a build type build in the same build request group. However, this is no longer valid as we don't
        want to set specified property for testing when only owned commit is built in previous build.
        'ifBuilt' needs to conditionally set property based on whether certain required repositories are built.
        Empty required repository list means no requirement on repository to set property.

        * tools/js/buildbot-syncer.js:
        (BuildbotSyncer.prototype._propertiesForBuildRequest):In the case of 'built', only set property when
        repository requirment is meet and there is a 'build' root request in the same build request group.
        (BuildbotSyncer._parseRepositoryGroup): Extend 'ifBuild' to pass information based on contition.

        Charts can be empty when values are all identical
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181828

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        Fixed the bug that when SampleVarianceUpperTriangularMatrix can store -Infinity as the initial cost
        of some entries when the sample standard deviation between two points turns out to be 0,
        and cause splitIntoSegmentsUntilGoodEnough to return undefiend because no segmentation has a finite cost.

        Also fixed the bug that the time series chart fails to show any data points when all data points have
        identical values as the entire y-coordinate gets collapsed to an empty value range by adjusting the max value
        when min & max values are identical.

        (TimeSeriesChart.prototype._ensureValueRangeCache): Raise the max slightly when min & max are identical
        to avoid the chart becoming empty. Otherwise valueDiff in _computeVerticalRenderingMetrics becomes 0
