        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115111

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        The install-dependencies script was missing a dependency on EGL,
        which is expected when building Cairo.

        * gtk/install-dependencies: Added a dependency on libegl1-mesa
        for both apt and yum.

        [EFL][WK2]: Fix WKViewClientWebProcessCallbacks WK2 API test
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114850

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Revision r148312 fixed WebPageProxy cleanup and also changed the process
        termination semantics when requested by the user so that a client is not
        notified of a crash anymore, since there was no crash anyway.

        That change broke WKViewClientWebProcessCallbacks WK2 API test, since it
        relied on being notified of a crash after calling WKPageTerminate(). As
        a result of not being notified of such non-existent crash, the test would
        timeout right after making the terminate call.

        This patch adds an InjectedBundle to be used for simulating a crash, by
        calling abort() upon receiving a "Crash" message, and thus we are able to
        keep testing the crash callback.

        This patch also re-enables the WKViewClientWebProcessCallbacks test, which
        had been disabled in revisions r148858 and r148855, since it was failing.

        Use different subfolders under DumpRenderTree Temp folder for every
        functionality (icon database, cache, localstorage, ...). This makes
        sure there is no conflict between the functionalities.

        In EFL's case, libsoup cache was causing problems for the icon
